Welcome aboard to my digital vessel, where the winds of curiosity propel us through the boundless expanse of music and technology. Here, amidst the waves of information, I've anchored a sanctuary for my passions and discoveries, with a beacon guiding fellow adventurers seeking enlightenment.

Embarking on this voyage, I envisioned a beacon of knowledge, a lighthouse illuminating the shores of understanding for all who dare to explore. Yet, beyond the altruistic call to share, lies a more personal journey, echoing the joys of teaching. In the dance between student and sage, I found a profound truth: to teach is to truly know.

Each encounter in this vast ocean of knowledge holds the potential to enrich our understanding, to transform fleeting moments into eternal treasures. Like messages in bottles or serendipitous discoveries amidst the currents, these experiences beckon to be embraced and woven into the fabric of our understanding.

Thus, I navigate not merely to collect, but to cultivate a legacy of comprehension. With each insight captured in the logbook of my thoughts, I transform transient encounters into enduring wisdom, charting a course towards deeper understanding and mastery.

So, join me aboard this vessel of discovery, as we hoist the sails of curiosity and navigate the seas of knowledge, capturing the essence of our experiences to weather any storm that may lie ahead.

Hi, and welcome to my website, where I catalogue a growing base of knowledge concerning my interests in music and tech. 

One of the reasons I created this website was to share what I learn, and in doing so, hopefully help others who are looking to further their knowledge base. Teaching is a joy - if it did not pay peanuts in the USA, I probably would still be working as a teacher.

And while an altruistic sales-pitch is great for generating feel-good feelings, the personal benefit to be gained from documenting what I learn is based off of my experiences with teaching. When one is forced to teach, one must know the subject inside and out. Along my voyage across the sea of knowledge I may encounter a message in a bottle with a new visualization approach for progressions in music, or perhaps I import a simplistic function pre-built in a Python package. However, if I simply leave those encounters as single-instance events, there is a very real chance that they float past me after a brief inspection of their potential applications. Therefore, I would much prefer to hoist these experiences from the ocean and onto my cataloging boat. Commit these events from a surface level, short-term encounter to the more permanent long-term, deeper-comprehension compartment of my personal collection of knowledge. And to do this, what better way than to record the events in my own words. -->
